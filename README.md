# Assignment Instructions

Follow the steps below carefully. Each step builds upon the previous one, so complete them in order.

## Part 2: Initial Setup
1. **Clone the repository**  
   Use `git clone <repo_url>` to download the repository to your local machine.

2. **Create a new text file**  
   - Name the file `name.txt`.  
   - The file should contain **only your full name** on the first line.  
   - Do not include any extra spaces, lines, or characters.

3. **Add, commit, and push the file**  
   - Run:  
     ```bash
     git add name.txt
     git commit -m "Add name.txt"
     git push
     ```

12. **Modify `ID.txt` on the main branch**  
    - Replace the placeholder text `psu_id`  
      with **your actual 9-digit PSU ID**.

13. **Add, commit, and push the updated file**  
    ```bash
    git add ID.txt
    git commit -m "Update ID.txt with PSU ID"
    git push
    ```

## Final Deliverable
At the end of this assignment:
- The repository should contain:
  - `name.txt` with your name.  
  - A merged version of `ID.txt` containing **both your PSU ID and the course name**.  
- All changes must be committed and pushed to the repository.
